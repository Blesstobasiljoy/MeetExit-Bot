## 📖 Overview

Have you ever zoned out during a meeting, only to realize 10 minutes later that you’re the only one left? 

**MeetExit Bot** is a browser extension built to handle your exit strategy. It monitors the real-time participant count of your Google Meet and automatically clicks the "Leave Call" button when the number of people drops below your chosen limit.

## ✨ Key Features

* **👁️ Live HUD:** A real-time "Head-Up Display" in the popup showing the exact participant count.
* **🎨 Theme Engine:** Switch between a Dark Mode and an Light Mode.
* **🚦 Visual Intelligence:**
    * **Green Pulse:** Safe zone (meeting is active).
    * **Red Pulse:** Danger zone (you are about to auto-leave).
    * **Neutral Grey:** Disconnected or idle status.
* **📱 Responsive Support:** Custom logic to find participant counts even in mobile-responsive or tiled layouts.
